Driver and helper classes for using simple files as an identifier mapping service.
<p>
For example, to use a tab-delimited text file as a mapping resource, you can use the following piece of code:  
<pre>
	class.forName("org.bridgedb.file.IDMapperText");
	mapper = BridgeDb.connect ("idmapper-text:file://path/to/file");
</pre>
