org.bridgedb.uri.sql
--------------------

To be renamed org.bridgedb.uri.sql

Main purpose is to provide a URI support layer on top of the org.bridgedb.sql package.

1. Mapping from URI to URI
2. Loading for URI to URI mappings
3. Mapping between DataSources and URI Patterns
    -Current implementation is a HACK and needs fixing!
4. Ability to get summary/count information about the mappings available.
